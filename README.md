# Final-DSA-Project-Stacks-Queue-Sorting-Recursion-
This project in C# aims to demonstrate key computer science concepts including Stacks and Queues via a parking garage simulation, Sorting through automatic sorting of user-entered numbers, and Recursion by computing factorial and Fibonacci sequences based on user input. Through practical implementations, users will gain insight into fundamental data structures and algorithms, enhancing their understanding of these core concepts.
